# HTML and CSS

Html tags and css selectors  

Html tags are the building blocks of web pages, defining the structure and content of a page. Some common html tags include:

- \<html>\</html>: Defines the root element of an html document
- \<head>\</head>: Contains metadata about the document, such as the page title and links to stylesheets
- \<body>\</body>: Contains the visible content of the page
- \<div>\</div>: Defines a block-level container for other html elements
- \<p>\</p>: Defines a paragraph of text
- \<a>\</a>: Defines a hyperlink

CSS selectors are used to target specific html elements and apply styles to them. Some common css selectors include:

- element selectors, such as `p` or `a`, which target all elements of that type
- class selectors, which target elements with a specific class attribute, such as `.my-class`
- id selectors, which target a single element with a specific id attribute, such as `#my-id`
- attribute selectors, which target elements with a specific attribute value, such as `[href]` to target all elements with an `href` attribute

HTML and CSS are two essential technologies used to create web pages. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used to define the structure and content of a web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is used to add styles and visual enhancements to web pages.

HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page. For example, the \<html>\</html> tag defines the root element of an HTML document. The \<head>\</head> tag contains metadata about the document, while the \<body>\</body> tag contains the visible content of the page. Other tags, such as \<div>\</div> and \<p>\</p>, are used to define containers and paragraphs of text, respectively. The \<a>\</a> tag is used to define hyperlinks.

CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. For example, the `p` selector targets all paragraphs of text on a page, while the `.my-class` selector targets all elements with the class "my-class". The `#my-id` selector targets a single element with the ID "my-id". Attribute selectors, such as `[href]`, are used to target elements with a specific attribute value.

Understanding HTML and CSS is essential for anyone looking to create web pages. By using these technologies effectively, you can create visually appealing and structurally sound web pages that are easy to navigate and use.
