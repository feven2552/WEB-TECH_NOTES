# The evolution of Internet and how it works summary

The revolution of the internet began in the late 20th century and has continued to evolve rapidly over the past few decades. The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that allows people to communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world.

The internet works by using a system of protocols and technologies that allow computers to communicate with each other. These protocols include **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**, which is used to transmit data packets across the network, and DNS (Domain Name System), which translates domain names into IP addresses.

At its core, the internet is made up of servers and routers that work together to transmit data between computers. Servers are powerful computers that store and serve up web pages, files, and other resources. Routers are devices that connect different networks together and route data packets between them.

The internet also relies on a system of standards and protocols that ensure compatibility between different devices and networks. These standards include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is used to create web pages, and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is used to transfer data between web servers and clients.

One of the key factors driving the revolution of the internet has been the development of new technologies such as broadband internet, wireless networking, cloud computing, social media, and mobile devices. These technologies have made it easier than ever for people to connect with each other, access information, and collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world.

Overall, the revolution of the internet has transformed virtually every aspect of modern life, from communication and entertainment to business and education. As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it's likely that we'll see even more dramatic changes in how we use and interact with this powerful global network.

## Computer evolution

The first computers were massive machines that occupied entire rooms and were only accessible to a select few. However, with advancements in technology, computers have become smaller, faster, and more powerful.

The first electronic computer was built in 1943 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. This computer was called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) and used binary digits to perform calculations. It was not until 1945 that the first general-purpose electronic computer was built by John von Neumann. This computer, known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), was capable of performing complex calculations at a much faster rate than any previous machine.

In the 1950s and 1960s, computers became more accessible to businesses and individuals. The development of programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL made it easier for people to write software for computers. In the 1970s, personal computers began to emerge with companies such as Apple and Microsoft leading the way.

One of the most significant advancements in computer technology has been the development of transistors. Transistors are tiny electronic devices that act as switches or amplifiers for electrical signals. They replaced vacuum tubes which were large, fragile, and consumed a lot of power.

## Transistors

Transistors were first invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs. They revolutionized electronics by making it possible to create smaller devices that consumed less power while still being able to perform complex tasks.

Today's modern computers contain billions of transistors on a single microchip. These microchips are capable of processing vast amounts of data at lightning-fast speeds while consuming very little power.

Transistors are essential components in modern computers. They are used to amplify and switch electronic signals, allowing for the processing and storage of information. Transistors are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon, which can be manipulated to control the flow of electrons.

In a computer, transistors are used in microprocessors, memory chips, and other electronic components. They allow for the rapid processing of data and the execution of complex instructions. The number of transistors in a computer chip has increased dramatically over time, leading to faster and more powerful computers.

The development of transistors has been a significant contributor to this evolution, making it possible to create smaller, faster, and more powerful devices.
